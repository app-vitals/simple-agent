# Vision: Execution Efficiency Assistant

## Overview

Transform Simple Agent from a general-purpose CLI assistant into a specialized **Execution Efficiency Assistant** that helps optimize daily task execution and long-term goal achievement.

## Core Philosophy

- **Simple and lightweight**: Maintain Unix philosophy principles
- **Context-aware**: Build rich context from multiple sources (calendar, Jira, Linear, files, projects)
- **Actionable**: Focus on helping determine *what's next* rather than just completing tasks
- **Iterative**: Start simple, add complexity incrementally

## Two Primary Use Cases

### 1. Daily Execution Efficiency

Help determine the highest-priority next action based on comprehensive context:

**Context Sources:**
- Calendar events and time availability (via MCP)
- Linear issues and project boards (via MCP - integrated)
- Trello boards and cards (via MCP - integrated)
- Toggl time tracking entries (via MCP - integrated)
- Recent work context (files edited, commits, PRs)
- Project timelines and deadlines
- Communication context (Slack threads, email priorities)

**Core Capabilities:**
- Ask: "What should I work on next?"
- Get intelligent prioritization considering:
  - Upcoming meetings and time blocks
  - Project deadlines and dependencies
  - Current sprint/iteration goals
  - Blocking vs. blocked work
  - Energy levels and task complexity matching
- Receive actionable recommendations with reasoning
- Quick context switching support

**Example Interactions:**
```
User: "What should I work on next?"

Agent: "Based on your context:
- You have 2 hours before your 2pm standup (calendar)
- Your Toggl tracker shows 3.5 hours on the API refactor today
- Linear sprint ends in 2 days with 3 tickets remaining
- Trello card "Deploy v2.0" is marked urgent

Recommendation: Focus on Linear ticket ENG-456 (auth bug - high priority, 90 min est.)

Reasoning:
- You've already invested time in API refactor (Toggl context)
- Sprint deadline is approaching (Linear context)
- Auth bug fits your remaining time block
- Deployment can wait until after sprint closes (Trello context)"
```

### 2. Long-term Execution Efficiency

Help set, track, and make incremental progress toward strategic goals:

**Goal Categories:**
- Content creation and sharing (blog posts, social media, talks)
- Revenue milestones and financial targets
- Company growth metrics (users, team size, market presence)
- Personal development and learning objectives
- Vision and strategy execution

**Core Capabilities:**
- Goal setting and decomposition into milestones
- Progress tracking and visualization
- Proactive nudging: "You haven't shared content in 2 weeks"
- Opportunity identification: "Your recent work on X would make a great blog post"
- Incremental progress suggestions that fit into daily workflow
- Success pattern recognition and reinforcement

**Example Interactions:**
```
User: "Help me make progress on content goals"

Agent: "Your goal: Share 2 technical posts per month
Status: 1/2 for October, 7 days remaining

Recent context suggests an opportunity:
- You just completed the webhook retry system (merged yesterday)
- This solves a common distributed systems problem
- You have 90 minutes free tomorrow morning

Suggestion: Draft a post on 'Building Resilient Webhooks'
- Outline: 30 min
- Draft: 45 min
- Polish: 15 min (can defer)

This leverages fresh work and fits your available time."
```

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Context is King

Rich, multi-source context enables intelligent recommendations:
- **Always-on context gathering**: Passively collect from integrations
- **Explicit context building**: Allow manual context addition
- **Context persistence**: Remember project details, goals, preferences
- **Context relevance**: Smart filtering to surface what matters

### 2. Proactive but Not Intrusive

Balance assistance with autonomy:
- Suggest, don't dictate
- Explain reasoning transparently
- Learn from user choices and feedback
- Respect focus time and flow states

### 3. Incremental Progress Over Perfection

Bias toward small, consistent actions:
- Break large goals into tiny next steps
- Celebrate micro-progress
- Find 15-minute opportunities for long-term goals
- Reduce activation energy for important-but-not-urgent work

### 4. Maintain Core Strengths

Keep what works from Simple Agent:
- **File operations**: Reading, creating, editing files remains core
- **Command execution**: Still runs commands when needed
- **Interactive CLI**: Familiar interface with enhancements
- **Tool-based architecture**: Extend with new integrations
- **Lightweight**: Fast startup, minimal overhead

## Technical Evolution

### Retained Elements

- Tool registry system (extend with new integration tools)
- File manipulation tools (core to context building)
- LLM integration via Claude
- Interactive CLI with prompt_toolkit
- Confirmation system for sensitive operations
- Token tracking and cost management

### New Components

**Context System:**
- Context aggregation layer via automatic LLM extraction
- Context storage and retrieval (disk-based JSON)
- Context injection into system prompt
- Context relevance scoring

**MCP Integration Layer:**
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) server support
- Pluggable external integrations (Toggl, Trello, Linear, Calendar)
- Tools dynamically registered from MCP servers
- Extensible to any MCP-compatible service

**Goal Management:**
- Goal definition and storage
- Progress tracking
- Milestone decomposition
- Success metrics

**Recommendation Engine:**
- LLM-based prioritization with reasoning
- Time-awareness (time tracking + calendar integration)
- Dependency analysis
- Energy/complexity matching

**Proactive Intelligence:**
- Agent-driven context gathering using available tools
- Goal inference from existing documents
- Opportunity detection from work patterns
- Progress awareness and gentle nudges

## Implementation Philosophy

### Start Simple, Iterate

**Phase 1: Foundation**
- Basic context gathering from 1-2 sources
- Simple "what's next" recommendations
- Manual context refresh

**Phase 2: Intelligence**
- Multi-source context via MCP tools
- Smart prioritization with reasoning
- Organic context building through natural interaction

**Phase 3: Proactive**
- Goal tracking and progress
- Proactive suggestions
- Pattern recognition

**Phase 4: Advanced**
- Predictive recommendations
- Learning from outcomes
- Cross-project optimization

### Iteration Cadence

- Ship small, functional increments
- Validate with real usage daily
- Adjust based on what actually helps
- Remove what doesn't add value

## Success Metrics

### Daily Efficiency Use Case
- Time saved on task selection
- Reduction in context-switching overhead
- User confidence in priorities
- Frequency of "this was the right call" moments

### Long-term Efficiency Use Case
- Goal completion rate
- Consistency of progress (weekly touch points)
- Opportunistic progress captures
- User satisfaction with goal achievement

## Future Possibilities

Ideas for later exploration:
- Team coordination mode (helping entire teams prioritize)
- Learning mode (analyze patterns in effective execution)
- Integration with pomodoro/time-blocking
- Voice interface for quick check-ins
- Mobile companion for on-the-go context
- Visualization dashboard for progress

## Anti-Goals

What this is NOT:
- Not a project management tool (we integrate with those)
- Not a replacement for planning (we help execute plans)
- Not a task tracker (we help pick from existing tasks)
- Not a heavy desktop app (stays lightweight CLI)
- Not AI doing work for you (AI helping you decide work)

---

## Summary

The Execution Efficiency Assistant transforms Simple Agent into a context-aware decision support tool that helps answer "what should I do next?" for both immediate tasks and long-term goals. It maintains simplicity and speed while adding intelligence through rich context integration and smart prioritization.

The assistant becomes your executive function partner: gathering context, suggesting priorities, tracking progress, and helping you maintain momentum on what matters most.
